Project evolving. 

Abstract: RPG where a player goes on a mini adventure through a small story navigating a labyrinth. The goal is to reach the center of the labyrinth where player has to solve a puzzle to win (or potentially move to a next level - but for this class project - only this one level).

Player will have opportunity to collect items and/or solve puzzles as they move through the adventure that may help or hinder the progress.
